Abstract 
"In a rapidly urbanizing world, this research delves into the intricate relationship between public transportation access and health outcomes in urban environments. Public transportation is a critical mode of transportation for populations at more significant risks of poor health outcomes; however, limited research has been conducted on these populations' ability to reach the resources needed to maintain their health. This study aimed to use multivariate regression analysis and cross-sectional data to examine the relationship between access via public transportation to essential health-promoting resources, such as supermarkets, employment centers, general practitioners, hospitals, and educational institutions, and health metrics, like Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) and Life Expectancy (LE). Areas with better access to hospitals via public transportation consistently showed improved health outcomes, while increased access to primary schools and supermarkets presented potential health concerns supporting a holistic approach to development to foster healthier urban communities. Recommendations for stakeholders include prioritizing direct public transport routes to vital health resources, developing transportation health hubs, and fostering collaboration with resource providers and their clients to ensure equitable health outcomes and bridge existing health disparities. However, the study faced limitations, including gaps in data and limited time scales. Future research should endeavor to compare these findings to more recent datasets and expand model parameters as the data becomes available."
